                <p class="bio-info1">American Ink Tattoo Company and Supply was founded in 2017. The shop was formerly Heart and Soul Tattoo Studio
                    founded in 2011 by resident artist George Boogyd Dungan. It quickly became very successful studio right
                    in the heart of OKC.</p>

                <p class="bio-info2">Life changes had George considering focusing more on his tattoo art than the business end of the industry,
                    since it did take much time away from actually being able to draw and paint in addition to tattooing.</p>

                <p class="bio-info3">Lisa McGuinness, a local professional in the music industry, was ready for a change in life. She purchased
                    the studio in 2016 and kept the name Heart and Soul for about a year. The shop then relocated, and merged
                    with a tattoo supply company also owned by McGuinness.</p>

                    <p> This is me, Boogy D. I'm a local tattoo artist in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. I have been tattooing for
                        about 17 years. I am a state licensed tattoo artist, and have been creating art my whole life. My
                        style has been influenced by everyday living and from my fellow peers and artists worldwide. I have
                        worked all over Oklahoma City and tour around America in the tattoo convention scene.</p>

                    <p>I am into creating something personal for my customers. I have a variety of styles, ranging from black
                        and grey, to traditional, realism, horror, cartoon, alternative, skateboard and religious themes.
                        I love keeping with my customer's vision and idea for their tattoo, while presenting them in a way
                        that compliments the skin so the idea can come to life. I am always up for a challenge and try to
                        be very informed on culture and custom creative tattoo styles. Thank you for visiting our site, and
                        I look forward to tattooing whatever your heart desires soon!</p>

                    <p>I was raised in Western Oklahoma and have lived in Oklahoma City since 1992 with a few years in Denver
                        and Dallas in between. I have been drawing and painting for as long as I can remember. I think like
                        most children my first intro to art was comic books and cartoons. I remember spending hours drawing
                        page after page of primitive marker renderings of superheros and Star Wars characters. I've had some
                        formal training in college, but am primarily self-taught. </p>

                    <p> I have been tattooing now for 13 years. I am influenced by a lot of surrealist and classical painters
                        as well as tattoo artists like Victor Portugal, Bob Tyrell, Liz Cook and hundreds of others I can't
                        even name. </p>

                    <p>Currently, I think I have the most fun with creating tattoos that mix traditional and abstract elements
                        like random geometry, drips, watercolor, etc. It would be my pleasure to design your next original
                        piece. Feel free to shoot me a text at 405-626-7110 for appointments, or message me on the American
                        Ink Tattoo Co. Facebook page. </p>

                    <p>Born and raised in San Antonio Texas. Growing up in a big city it was easy to find my own way of expressing
                        myself as an artist. From having formal paint exhibits with oils and acrylic, to painting walls,
                        trains and freeway underpasses.</p>

                    <p>Ten years ago a friend gave me my first machine. I fell in love, and believe it’s an honor and privilege
                        to have someone let me permanently add my art to their body. I take a lot of pride in knowing that
                        people trust my skills as and artist, and I will always do my best to give someone something they
                        are proud of. So, with that being said, I will always continue to push and grow as an tattoo artist.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy doing all styles of tattooing, whether it's traditional, new school, realism, trash polka, or
                        abstract, and I always look forward to the challenge of covering up unwanted tattoos!</p>

                            <p>My name is Roberto Escobar, I have enjoyed drawing since I was young. I remember always getting in trouble for drawing in church and school. I took an art class in highschool, and while it was fun to learn new mediums, pencil and paper has always been my favorite. </p> 
                            
                            <p> I've always had older cousins and friends with really cool tattoos. Several of them told me I should get into tattooing, since I like to draw so much. I wasn't sure I was good enough, but I went for it anwyay. After some time searching, I got in touch with Lisa, and Boog agreed to take me on as an apprentice. </p>

                            <p> My apprenticeship has been awesome, and I've really enjoyed learning from everyone in the shop. My favorite style to tattoo is black and grey, but I've been getting into color lately. I'm a graduate apprentice, and I plan to continue learning everyday. </p>

                            <p> Some of my inspirations are Freddy Negrete, Mark Mahoney, Franco Vascovi, Flaks, Sir Twice, Fonzy, bob Tyrrel, Mr. Cartoon and more. One day I hope to be able to travel the world doing what I love, just like I've seen them doing. </p>
